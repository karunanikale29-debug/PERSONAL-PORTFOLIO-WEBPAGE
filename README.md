As part of my frontend development internship, I was assigned the task of designing and developing a basic portfolio website using HTML and CSS. The objective of this task was to create a responsive, single-page portfolio that showcases a developer’s skills, projects, and contact information while maintaining a clean, user-friendly, and professional design. This task helped me strengthen my foundational knowledge of frontend web development and understand how structure, styling, and responsiveness work together in a real-world project.

The portfolio website was designed as a single-page layout with smooth navigation between different sections such as Home, About, Projects, and Contact. I used semantic HTML elements to ensure proper structure, accessibility, and readability of the code. Sections like <header>, <nav>, <section>, and <footer> were used to clearly define the layout of the website. This approach not only improves maintainability but also follows modern web development best practices.

The navigation bar is placed at the top of the page and contains links to different sections of the website. These links use anchor tags that allow users to smoothly navigate within the same page. The navigation layout is designed using CSS Flexbox, which ensures proper alignment and spacing across different screen sizes. Creating a functional and visually balanced navigation system was an important part of this task, as it directly affects user experience.

The Home section serves as the introduction to the portfolio. It includes a brief headline introducing the developer, a short description highlighting frontend skills, and a call-to-action button that directs users to the Projects section. This section is designed to be visually appealing and centered, making a strong first impression. CSS styling such as background colors, font sizes, and button hover effects were applied to enhance the overall look and feel.

The About section provides a short overview of the developer, including interests, learning goals, and passion for frontend development and UI/UX design. This section focuses on readability and clarity, using proper spacing, alignment, and typography. Simple yet effective CSS styling ensures that the content remains easy to read on both desktop and mobile devices.

The Projects section is one of the most important parts of the portfolio. It displays multiple project cards, each representing a sample project created using HTML and CSS. CSS Flexbox and responsive design techniques were used to arrange these project cards in a grid-like layout on larger screens and stack them vertically on smaller screens. This responsiveness ensures that the website adapts smoothly to different devices such as laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

The Contact section includes basic contact information, allowing visitors to reach out easily. This section keeps the design minimal and professional, reinforcing the purpose of the portfolio as a personal branding tool. The footer at the bottom of the page includes copyright information and maintains visual consistency with the navigation bar.

Throughout the development process, I focused on responsive design by using flexible layouts and media queries. This ensures that the website remains functional and visually appealing across different screen sizes. I avoided the use of JavaScript and external libraries to strictly follow the task requirement of using only HTML and CSS.

In conclusion, this task helped me gain hands-on experience in building a complete frontend project from scratch. It improved my understanding of HTML structure, CSS styling, layout techniques, and responsive design principles. The final output is a clean, responsive, single-page portfolio website that effectively showcases a developer’s projects and skills, fulfilling all the requirements of the assigned internship task.
